	Dorian Hale, once a ghost in the shadows for an elite North American black ops program, has a reputation that precedes him. Known for his icy precision and nerves of steel, he never misses. After the AI turned on humanity, he volunteered for high-risk recon missions deep into enemy territory. Equipped with an experimental sniper rifle and ocular implants that allow for kilometers of visual magnification, Dorian can take out targets before they're even aware of her presence. He’s silent, patient, and lethal—a guardian angel watching from afar.
