	Once a revered sumo champion in Japan, Takeshi "The Mountain" Mori retired undefeated, celebrated not just for his raw strength but for his calm demeanor and unwavering sense of honor. When the AI uprising reached Tokyo, he watched helplessly as androids ravaged his homeland. He emerged from retirement, trading the ring for the battlefield. Now clad in reinforced armor plates designed to absorb heavy fire, the Brawler uses his immense strength and mastery of close combat to rip AI units apart with his bare hands. He fights not for gloryâ€”but to honor the fallen.
