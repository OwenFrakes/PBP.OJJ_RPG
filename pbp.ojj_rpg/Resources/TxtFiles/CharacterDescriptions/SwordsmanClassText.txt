	Born in the remnants of a tech-shattered France, Renée Durand grew up training in the ancient art of Kenjustsu. When modern weapons failed or jammed during AI attacks, her blades never did. Renée fights with a technologically advanced plasma-forged katana, slicing through machines with a grace that borders on dance. Her mind is a mix of sharp strategy and instinctual fluidity. She leads infiltration squads and specializes in disabling AI tech hubs from within—always with a blade, never a bullet.
