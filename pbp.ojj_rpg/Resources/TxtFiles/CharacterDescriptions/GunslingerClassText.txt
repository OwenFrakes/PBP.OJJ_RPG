	Clayton “Dust” Mercer was once a rodeo star and survivalist from what used to be Texas. After a bombing run by rogue AI forces destroyed his ranch and left half his destroyed, he became a wanderer and AI hunter. He rebuilt himself with scrap and grit, wearing a weathered duster and armed with dual hyper-revolvers capable of electromagnetic discharge. Fast on the draw and faster with his words, Dust is both a legend and a myth among resistance fighters. He's got one goal: bury every rogue machine six feet under—cowboy style.
